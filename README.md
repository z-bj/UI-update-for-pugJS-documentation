# Pug.js Technical Documentation UI Upgrade
This GitHub repository contains an upgraded user interface (UI) for the technical documentation of Pug.js, implemented with HTML and CSS only.

## Description

Pug.js is a popular templating engine for JavaScript, widely used for web development. The official technical documentation for Pug.js provides essential information on how to use the library, its syntax, and its features.

However, the default UI of the Pug.js technical documentation can be improved to provide a better user experience. This project aims to address this issue by upgrading the UI of the Pug.js technical documentation, using only HTML and CSS.

## Features

The upgraded UI for the Pug.js technical documentation includes the following features:

-   A modern, clean, and responsive design that enhances readability and accessibility.
-   A well-organized navigation menu that allows users to quickly find the information they need.
-   Consistent styling and formatting of code examples and other elements, making them easy to understand and follow.
-   Clear and concise documentation that provides all the necessary information on Pug.js.

## Usage

To use the upgraded UI for the Pug.js technical documentation, simply download the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can clone the repository and host it on your own server.
